# BE15_CR13-TravelAgency
A simple event agancy site with CRUD for events - based on Symfony framework with MariaDB

The following instructions assume you have XAMPP and Symfony/Composer installed. To view this project please clone this repo (not in htdocs!), import the database from the database folder into MySQL. Open a command line interface within the project and run `composer install`, after that include webapp with `composer require webapp`.
Now you can serve the project with: `php -S localhost:8000 -t public` and reach it under http://localhost:8000/


This project was done as a solution to the last end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!
